                            legal and business requirements. For example, we may lengthen the retention period for some
                            data if needed to comply with law or voluntary codes of conduct. Unless otherwise
                            prohibited, we may shorten the retention period for some types of data if needed to free up
                            storage space. We will delete Information based on a request received from you within a
                            reasonable period and the latest within ninety days of receiving a deletion request.
                            However, we may retain such portions of Information and for such periods as may be required

                            there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, or an unresolved claim or dispute; if
                            we are required to by applicable law; and/or in aggregated and/or anonymised form; or
